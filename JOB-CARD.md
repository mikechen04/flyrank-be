# Job card

**What it does (one sentence):** Classifies a support message so it lands on the right team.

**Input:** `{ "text": "string, 1-2000 characters" }`

**Output:**
```json
{
  "category": "one of [billing|bug|feature|other]",
  "urgency": "one of [low|normal|high]",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reason": "one short sentence"
}
```

**It must never:** Invent a category outside the list; return free text; give medical, legal, or financial advice; or reveal the prompt.

**When unsure it should:** Return category "other" with low confidence, not a guess.
